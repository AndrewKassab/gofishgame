# Setup
   - Download and run the executable jar file
   OR
   - Clone the project and run it from within eclipse or the command line 
   
# How to Play

   This game follows standard rules for go fish. You will ask your opponent
   for a card in hopes of obtaining a match. If your hand is empty, you will
   draw a card instead. The player with the most matches at the end wins. 

   - When asking for face cards, use the first letter of the card's name,
   for example when asking for a king, just input 'K'.
   
# Project Details
   
   This project began as a simple text-based game as a tool for learning
   how to use stacks and eventually evolved into my tool for learning
   how to use swing and java GUIs.
   
 # Goals 
   
   - Turn cards to JButtons, add action listeners and use buttons to intereact with game
   rather than prompting user input through text.
