# How to play

   This game follows standard rules for go fish. You will ask your opponent
   for a card in hopes of obtaining a match. If your hand is empty, you will
   draw a card instead. The player with the most matches at the end wins. 

   - When asking for face cards, use the first letter of the card's name,
   for example when asking for a king, just input 'K'.
   
# Project Details
   
   This project began as a simple text-based game as a tool for learning
   how to use stacks and eventually evolved into my tool for learning
   how to use swing and java GUIs.
   
 # What I learned
   
   - Updating and maintaining old code, making cleaner code / documentation
   - Using and creating GUIs in Java, managing multiple components and layout managers. 
   - How to efficiently debug a program.
   - Cutting down code into smaller and more efficient methods. 
   - Simple CPU / A.I player coding. 
   - How to work with a game
   - Using external resources (images, etc.) 
   
 # Goals 
   
   - Turn cards to JButtons, add action listeners and use buttons to intereact with game
   rather than prompting user input through text.
